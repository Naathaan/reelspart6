clause: and driving him toward madness.
prompt: Prompt:
Illustrate a scene depicting the mental deterioration of Aleister Crowley as he is being driven towards insanity by the uncontrollable quantum biophysical presence of the god Pan. The image should reflect a dramatic transformation from Crowley's initial collected demeanor to his chaotic, unhinged state as a result of the failed ritual. Portray the overwhelming energy of Pan's presence as a visible force, perhaps depicted as an aura or ghostly figure, that wraps and disorients Crowley. The room he's in should be filled with symbols and artifacts of the dark summoning ritual. Show the stark change in Crowley's face, his eyes wide with fear and confusion, sweat dripping down his brow, and his mouth agape in an unheard scream. This image should encapsulate the potent power of non-human energy fields and their destructive effects on the human psyche.

clause: but also travel to a four-dimensional space believed to house what was referred to as "intelligent infinity".
prompt: Create a highly detailed image showcasing travel to a four-dimensional space, perceived to be the dwelling of the "intelligent infinity." The scene should begin with a monumental portal opening; this is the hyperdimensional barrier connected to the Ark of the Covenant. The portal should shroud in mystical spectacles, pulsating with radiant energy, hinting at a potentially dangerous radiation journey ahead. The transition from our familiar three-dimensional space to a transcendent four-dimensional one needs to be communicated. This four-dimensional realm is a vibrant, fluid dreamscape where the laws of time and space reshape, a realm often subverted by spiraling tesseracts and looping planes. This space believed to house the "intelligent infinity" should possess an aura of ancient wisdom and infinite knowledge, represented by advanced translucent architectures with complex geometrical structures, floating celestial libraries, or glowing ancient symbols integrating into the fabric of reality. There should be symbolism that hints at the strong presence of higher-dimensional intelligences, such as glowing celestial entities, patterns of cosmic code, or intricate fractal designs. Remember to emphasize the majestic and concurrently overwhelming aspect of encountering such vast otherworldly wisdom & intelligence.

clause: The clause doesn't need to be split into smaller units. It's understandable as it is:
prompt: "Israeli priests in Jerusalem would tie ropes around their ankles to prevent being pulled into the hyperdimensional entryway the Ark created."

Descriptive Prompt: 

Imagine a scene at an ancient temple in Jerusalem, where the sacred Ark of Covenant is placed on an elevated stone pedestal. The Ark emanates an ethereal glow, indicating its active state as a hyperdimensional doorway. Around this sanctum, Israeli priests are preparing for the communication rituals with higher realms. They wear traditional vestments woven from pure linen, their foreheads marked and hands stained from sacred rituals. Each of them carries a long, sturdy rope made of tightly coiled fibers. The ropes are a precautionary measure, grounded at the temple's foundation at one end, and tied securely around the priests' ankles at the other, to prevent them from being pulled into the unseen dimensions. The tension of the ropes is palpable as they strain against the invisible forces at play. It's a powerful image, reflecting the might of the mysterious hyperdimensional entryway the Ark creates, and the necessary precautions one must undertake to interact with it.

clause: 
prompt: "The ark itself was a plasma generator, made from stone sourced from Mount Garrison, which was long believed to be an ancient site linked to mystical properties."

Prompt: 

Envision the Ark of the Covenant not simply as a religious artifact, but as a potent and mysterious piece of technology - a plasma generator. Picture it carefully crafted from stone. But not just any stone, this stone specifically sourced from Mount Garrison, a location steeped in ancient lore and assumed to possess enchanted properties. The construction and materials of the Ark were not random; they were chosen for their purported mystical elements, leading some to believe that the Ark was more than a mere container of divine commandments. The image visualizes the ark radiating with energy, an aura that is palpable and proof of its reality as a plasma generator, which lends credibility to the accounts of its extraordinary powers. The implications of this understanding are enormous, suggesting a fusion of faith, mysticism, science, and advanced technology encapsulated in this single religious artifact. The image weaves together the old and the new, the tangible and the ethereal, hinting at the breadth of knowledge our ancestors may have possessed.

error for reel 3
clause: In Tim Rifat's "Remote Viewing",
prompt: In the context of the rich mythology surrounding the Ark of the Covenant, direct specific attention to Tim Rifat's "Remote Viewing". For this particular writing prompt, imagine the vivid description of an ancient scene within the heart of Jerusalem, where Israeli priests make a daring interaction with the Ark. Include details that portray the tense preparation leading to the encounter — they tie ropes around their ankles in anticipation of the sheer force of the hyperdimensional doorway said to be communications and travel route to intelligent infinity. Elaborate on the fear, awe, and determination in the air as these priests engage with the Ark. Give a nod to the implications of the hefty price they risk paying, the chance of being sucked into a different dimension or suffering a fatal illness associated with potential radiation poisoning from the plasma generator within the Ark. Consider highlighting the paradox of their positions — on one hand, they bear the important task of communicating with higher-dimensional intelligences, and yet on the other, they are perpetually at the precipice of fatal sacrifice.

error for reel 3
clause: The clause does not need to be split into smaller units as it seems to provide a complete thought. It is perfectly intelligible within the context of the paragraph. So, the clause should be returned as is:
prompt: "The ark of the covenant functioning as a hyperdimensional doorway, allowing both communication and travel to an enigmatic and mysterious realm known as the four-dimensional space or 'intelligent infinity'. A vivid spectacle, with awe and suspense encapsulating the atmosphere, as Israeli priests in Jerusalem actively operate this powerful tool. Their bodies are secured by ropes tied around their ankles, preventing them from unknowingly entering the hyperdimensional gateway opened by the Ark. Picture this mesmerizing artifact, carefully carved from stone procured from the mystical Mount Garrison - rumoured to be an ancient site steeped in mysticism and secret powers. As part of the tableau, consider how the Ark emits an invisible, potentially fatal aura - is it radiation or something more otherworldly? - causing unprepared individuals to fall ill upon approach. Finally, conceptualize the notion proposed by the Law of One, a theory suggesting that only individuals who have tuned their spiritual frequencies correctly and meticulously performed the necessary rituals can stave off the harmful radiation and enable productive communication with higher-dimensional entities."

error for reel 3
clause: "An account describes how Israeli priests in Jerusalem would tie ropes around their ankles to prevent being pulled into the hyperdimensional entryway the Ark created."
prompt: Create a vivid, intense image portraying a group of ancient Israeli priests in the heart of Jerusalem. Center the image on a single priest standing fearlessly in front of the majestic Ark of the Covenant, which is animated by the aura of a radiating plasma generator, emitting ethereal energies that hint at a mysterious doorway to a hyperdimensional space. The Ark is made from stone sourced from Mount Garrison and glows with mystic properties. Beneath the priest's robes, make visible the sturdy rope tied securely around his ankle - a lifeline to our earthly realm and a safeguard against the powerful pull of the otherworldly doorway. The other end of the rope disappears off-frame, held by unseen colleagues ready to pull their peer from the doorway's irresistible attraction. This intense scene echos the danger and religious gravitas that underscores the belief in the Ark's extraordinary abilities, and the great lengths taken to interact with the "intelligent infinity" without being consumed by it. In the faces of the priests, show a mixture of anticipation, reverence, and a trace of fear, demonstrating their awareness of the spiritual alignment and preparation needed to survive this daunting process.

error for reel 3
clause: The ark itself was a plasma generator,
prompt: Create an image depicting the ark of the covenant in a mystical and sacred setting. The ark is not just a relic, but a powerful plasma generator, radiating an enigmatic aura that seems to distort the space around it. Made of stone from Mount Garrison, it has a rugged, time-worn texture that emanates an air of ancient wisdom. It's carefully crafted design could even suggest an otherworldly origin. The surrounding scene should maintain the balance between the awe-inspiring yet dangerous nature of the ark; given its ability to poison those who approach it unprepared while simultaneously opening a hyperdimensional doorway. The ark should glow with a kind of supernatural energy, pulses of light and plasma visually hinting towards its capacity to establish connections with higher-dimensional realms. The stone it is made of should be shown as absorbing this radiant energy, further establishing the complex relationship between the ark and its lethal radiation. The ark is a means of travel and communication, a mystical machine that fascinates yet threatens, a perfect metaphor for the access to knowledge and the risks it entails.

error for reel 3
clause: made from stone
prompt: Prompt:

In the radiant moonlight stands the magnificent ark of the covenant, carved exquisitely from a special kind of stone. This stone is not just any ordinary geological material, but one sourced from the mystical Mount Garrison. Legend has it that this ancient site is imbued with mystical properties, making the stone sourced from it unique and potent. The stone, in earthly hues of grey and brown, is both sturdy and majestic. It's the very core element of the ark making it a powerful plasma generator, used for opening a hyperdimensional doorway. Bring to life in your image the intricate details and textures of the stone; show the series of mysterious symbols or carvings etched onto the surface of the ark. Depict the ark in such a way that describes its origin from an ancient mystical mountain and its exceptional electromagnetic ability which many believe to cause radiation poisoning. Propel the viewer into the feeling of awe and caution provoked by this powerful element in the ark of the covenant's construction and operation.

clause: sourced from Mount Garrison,
prompt: Generate an image of Mount Garrison, depicted as an ancient, mystical site abundant with lore. The mountain is imposing and shrouded in mystery, with towering peaks dusted with snow and forests cloaked in an eternal mist. Hidden within its rugged landscapes, are quarries where stones, glowing with an ethereal luminescence, are mined. These stones are believed to contain unique properties that make them capable of constructing plasma generators like the Ark of the Covenant. Their radiance indicates their potential to serve as the basis for powerful, supernatural artifacts. The setting should reflect a sense of awe, reverence, and potential danger associated with the mountain's products which are closely linked to the opening of hyperdimensional doorways and spiritual rituals. The image should portray Mount Garrison as an indispensable source rich in mystical traditions.

error for reel 3
clause: Interestingly,
prompt: there are plenty of independent references of people becoming ill when approaching the Ark

Descriptive Prompt:
Create an image illustrating various independent references of people feeling sick while drawing closer to the Ark of Covenant. The Ark itself should be depicted as a magnificent and imposing object, emanating a noticeable glow suggesting its character as a plasma generator. Littered around the scene, portray humans from different times and societies, from Israeli priests in traditional robes to modern explorers in exploration attire, appearing physically distressed or ill. Show distinct expressions of discomfort on their faces, some may be clutching their stomachs, while others are just barely holding onto their consciousness, providing a clear reference to the supposed radiation poisoning. Despite the unmistakable beauty and allure of the Ark, the dangers it poses should be equally palpable in this visual representation. The image should reflect the paradox of the Ark - while it's the key to a higher dimension, it brings potential suffering to those who dare approach it without suitable spiritual attunement and ritualistic preparation.

clause: and who have prepared properly using specific rituals,
prompt: The image illustrates a group of people preparing for their encounter with the Ark of the Covenant, emphasizing their meticulous adherence to specific rituals. These rituals, thought to provide spiritual attunement and protection from the hypothesized radiation emitted by the ark, are shown in intricate detail. From the ancient symbols they scribe onto the floor, to the vestments they wear bearing cryptic insignias, everything oozes an air of sacred methodology. A select few individuals are featured more prominently, likely the priests of Jerusalem, shown in the act of donning ropes around their ankles, a nod to historical accounts. A palpable sense of both reverence and apprehension pervades the devoted group as they each mentally and physically prepare themselves for the approaching encounter with the hyperdimensional entryway. Yet, despite the dangers, there's an anticipation in their eyes. They stand convicted in their belief in the mystical, and for them the risk of radiation poisoning is a worthy trade-off for the chance to communicate with higher-dimensional intelligences. This image delves deep into the spiritual and somewhat perilous preparation that these people undertake in service of their higher calling.

error for reel 3
clause: can survive the radiation poisoning emitted from the ark,
prompt: Prompt: 

Depict an image capturing the concept of survival amid the dangerous radiation emitted by the Ark of the Covenant. Pay close attention to the nuanced idea that only those who are spiritually attuned and have conducted specified rituals can withstand the harmful radiation. Illustrate individuals exhibiting an aura or shield, symbolizing their spiritual strength and preparation, protecting them from the palpable waves of radiation coming from the ark. The ark itself, made from the mystical Mount Garrison stone, should be situated centrally in your composition, radiating raw, otherworldly power in the form of thermal light rays. The image should evoke a sense of danger for most, but for the prepared individuals, it should imply an opportunity for mystical communication with higher-dimensional beings. The background can show others, without the protective aura, suffering from the deadly effects while the chosen ones endure, reinforcing the gravity and exclusivity of the scenario.
