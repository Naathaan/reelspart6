    "After death,": "Image Description Prompt: \n\nImagine the intriguing moment immediately after death, as perceived by the departed spirit. Show the spirit in a setting, possibly still resembling the familiar physical world it so recently departed from. Depict the surroundings in detailed and vivid aspects, showing a posture of bewilderment as the spirit grapples with its new reality. In this image, there should be a feeling of a transition, reflecting that the spirit has left its corporeal existence but has not yet fully entered the next realm of the afterlife. The spirit might still have a visible form, but slightly translucent, to suggest its incorporeal nature. Perhaps it interacts with its surroundings, objects, and furniture - some of which are subtly misplaced or distorted - strengthening the feeling of quiet disorientation and hinting towards the subtle anomalies of the afterlife realms.",
    "most people do n’t realize they have died": "Imagine an image depicting the ambiguity of the afterlife, where individuals have transcended to a realm that remarkably mirrors the physical world. The focus of this image should be on people who, despite being deceased, don't recognize their own passing. These people may be carrying out their usual, everyday tasks, mirroring life as they knew it, thus showcasing their lack of awareness regarding their death. The expressions on their faces would reflect curiosity, confusion, or disbelief. Include all ages, genders, and races to underscore that this phenomenon applies to everyone. Also, include subtle views of unusual occurrences in the background to visualize the anomalies mentioned, such as a full glass that never seems to empty, or a book where words constantly rearrange themselves. These anomalies should serve as clues that suggest the metaphysical otherworldliness of the environment, as a symbol of their transition into death.",
    "and often experience significant confusion.": "Prompt: \n\nIn an illustration of this clause, depict a newly deceased spirit experiencing significant confusion in their afterlife. The spirit should look ethereal, with a transparent quality, and have a bewildered expression to portray the disorientation and perplexity they are feeling. The setting should resemble a familiar worldly place, like a room in a house; however, it should include several anomalies that contribute to the spirit's confusion - a chair hanging in the air, a clock with hands moving counterclockwise, an inverted painting on the wall, or a door that leads to the sky, for instance. Additionally, the spirit might be holding a perpetually full glass or a book with jumbled words. The representation should powerfully capture this moment of feeling lost and disoriented, mirroring the bewilderment experienced in waking up to the unexpected reality of the afterlife.",
    "This is": "Prompt: \n\nIn an image, depict the realization that comes after death. Highlight the intense confusion a spirit might experience as it navigates the afterlife realms, eerily similar to the physical world they were once familiar with. The surrounding area should feel familiar, but slightly off, containing subtle oddities that hint at the difference from the earthly plane. Perhaps furniture is hovering slightly off the ground or a drink in a glass is never empty, no matter how much it is consumed. Portray a spirit trying to read a book, but the words keep shifting and scrambling before their eyes. To further illustrate the strange workings of the afterlife, depict someone walking towards a far-off building, then the next moment they are suddenly there, at the doorstep. As the image progresses, the vibrant colors and vivid details should start to fade, indicating the fading vitality of the spirit and the impending transition to the next plane of existence.",
    "because the afterlife realms closely resemble the physical world.": "Prompt:\n\nCreate an image that perfectly captures the unique intersection between physicality and ethereality, represented by the clause: \"because the afterlife realms closely resemble the physical world.\" This image should be a blend of both familiar and unfamiliar, reflecting the notion that the boundary between life and afterlife isn't as definitive as one might think. Imagine an ethereal cityscape that mirrors our earthly architecture, filled with houses, streets, and parks. Yet, they are rendered in softened, otherworldly hues. The celestial bodies seem misplaced, like two moons in a daytime sky. The inhabitants appear like illusions, their form recognizably human, but translucent and shimmering. The image should not only portray the stark similarities, but also highlight the subtle deviations which blur the lines, creating a mystical ambience. This portrait of transition heightens the peculiar feeling of déjà vu, underlining that the afterlife is an eerie reflection of the life left behind, causing confusion and awe in those who find themselves suddenly within its grasp.",
    "The only things": "Prompt: \n\nVisualize a surrealistic depiction of the afterlife, a realm that mirrors the physical world in an uncanny manner. The only elements to differentiate it from the mortal plane are anomalies scattered throughout. Picture strange objects, out of place in their surroundings: a fancy Victorian couch sitting in the middle of a dense forest, a grandfather clock ticking away in the shallow waters of a beach. Imagine a filled glass that, despite constant sips, remains perpetually full or words in a book, that swirl and mix, losing all coherence when attempted to read. Show a figure beginning to walk down the road, but then arriving at the destination in the blink of an eye, illustrating the fluidity of time and space in this realm. Over time, this vivid reality starts to lose its vitality, hinting the transition of the spirit to another plane. This scene should capture the perplexity of the newly departed souls, who gradually accept the peculiarities as signs of their transition.",
    "that give the afterlife realms away are the anomalies.": "Create an image illustrating the subtle anomalies that betray the nature of the afterlife realms. The scene should generally look like an ordinary, familiar setting - perhaps a comfortable living room or a bustling city - but dotted with strange occurrences that suggest this is not the physical world. Tastefully misplaced furniture seemingly defying gravity, objects phasing in and out of existence, or a book with constantly shifting, jumbled words are the odd manifestations that hint at the spiritual nature of this realm. The glass of water on a table in the corner should perpetually refill itself, subtly hinting at the endlessness of the afterlife. In the distance, a figure should be depicted as embarking on a journey towards a destination, only to appear there instantaneously in the next moment. The color palette should be muted and gradually fading towards the edges of the painting, symbolizing the ebbing vitality of the spirits and their impending transition to the next plane of existence. The image needs to blend the beauty of normalcy with the uncanny yet gentle intrigues of the anomalous in the afterlife realm.",
    "These might include misplaced furniture": "Prompt: \n\nImagine a setting that appears to be an ordinary, familiar room - perhaps a living room or study - but nestled within its familiarity reside unsettling elements of incongruity. This is a realm where physical laws of our existence are shockingly distorted. Visualize furniture that has been bizarrely misplaced: a ceiling-hung sofa, a floor-based chandelier, books stacked horizontally on a bookshelf, a mirror standing in the middle of the room instead of on the wall. And it doesn't stop there. Picture these objects shifting positions without any apparent will or force, causing a ceaseless ripple of bewilderment. The irregular and displaced furniture pieces assert the disorienting nature of the afterlife realm, where spatial and temporal constructs are profoundly warped. This chaotic yet unmistakably familiar environment mirrors the initial confusion experienced by a spirit post death, subtly hinting at its transition into an alternative existence.",
    "or objects": "Prompt: \n\nCreate an image depicting the anomalies that set the afterlife realms apart from the physical world, focusing specifically on misplaced or anomalous objects. These could be everyday objects that are surprisingly out of place or behaving unusually - for example, a clock hanging in midair or a teacup floating upside down. Perhaps there's a stretch of hallway that's paved with piles of vintage novels, or a garden where exotic, bioluminescent flowers grow in old, rusted bathtubs. It's a world where the abnormal is normal. Also, consider showing the reactions of people who may be interacting or noticing these odd objects for the first time, reflecting their initial confusion at these peculiar occurrences. A sense of surreality should permeate through this depiction.",
    "and other strange occurrences.": "Prompt:\n\nDepict an ethereal scene that encapsulates the mysticism of the afterlife characterized by \"other strange occurrences\" in an environment familiar yet subtly altered. The scene should include subtle details that reflect the idiosyncratic nature of this spiritual realm. Consider including an aspect of time behaving unpredictably - for instance, a sundial whose shadow moves counter to its expected trajectory or an hourglass with sand suspended in midair. Think about elements of nature acting outside their established norms, like a tree with leaves blossoming in the heart of winter, a bird flying backwards, or a waterfall flowing upwards towards the sky. There might be a mirror showing a reflection with a different outfit or a different time of day, or doors and windows leading to impossible destinations. Each of these odd discrepancies should contribute to an atmosphere of gentle disorientation, highlighting the alien logic of this realm while also reflecting its uncanny resemblance to the physical world.",
    "You may notice your glass is never empty,": "Prompt:\n\nImagine a mystifying scene where natural laws seem to be defying themselves. One seemingly ordinary element makes it otherwise – a glass, half-filled with a shimmering liquid. No matter how many thirsty gulps are taken from it or how much time lapses, the liquid level remarkably remains unchanged; the glass is never empty. The liquid, resembling a common earthly beverage, continues to swirl occasionally with a life of its own, calmly defying depletion. This strange phenomenon might seem initially comforting, signaling abundance and infinity. However, the recurring discomforting realization that the glass is unendingly refreshed – without the interference of any visible entity - raises questions and instills a sense of eeriness. It becomes an uncanny symbol of how reality is subtly distorted in the afterlife realm, slowly revealing the abnormality of this new existence.",
    "or you try to read,": "Prompt: \n\nImagine an individual who has just entered the afterlife realm and is still trying to comprehend the altered reality of this new environment. Specifically, visualize them attempting to read a book they once loved on Earth, perhaps a thick, leather-bound tome with gold leaf-lined pages. The pages appear the same, but as they try to read, the neatly printed lines slowly start to blur, shifting and writhing like living creatures. The letters lose their form, transforming into indiscernible symbols, even if the reader is a well-educated scholar. This alteration in text mirrors the strange nature of the afterlife, an echo of the physical space they once occupied but different enough to differ significantly. Imply this phenomenon as being not frightening but disorienting - a direct consequence of the afterlife's mysterious, elusive rules dissociated from time and logic. This should represent the peculiar experience of trying to read in the afterlife - where words no longer follow the familiar patterns of the physical world.",
    "and the words jumble;": "Prompt: \n\nUsing the afterlife from the provided context, visualize an ethereal library filled with ancient books and literary masterpieces. Everything seems at ease, clean and orderly, closely resembling the physical world but with a slightly lucid quality. Within this realm, the tension lies in the anomaly of reading. As an onlooker tries to read a book, instead of lines of prose and poetry, its characters seem to fall into a chaotic dance, whirling and reshaping - the words jumble. The words from beloved stories and grand narratives cannot be read cleanly or traditionally, they defy the laws of structure and order. They create intriguing patterns on the page, mutating, intertwining, and moving in a rhythm distinct to the supernatural realm. They maintain their physical form, bounding off the page in spectral ink, but make no logical arrangement to the human or spirit eye. This unusual activity signifies the strange happenings of the afterlife and how laws of nature and pillars of normality become scrambled and redefined. This anomaly begins to gently reveal the difference between our world and the next plane of existence.",
    "or you might start walking toward a destination only to find yourself there instantly.": "Prompt:\n\nImagine a world where the traditional rules of time and space are subtly bent or altered. In this world, you might start a journey by stepping towards a familiar destination. As you take your first step, envision the sensation of your foot hitting the ground, your surroundings still seemingly grounded in reality, the objective of your journey still appearing to be far ahead. However, as you lift your foot for the next stride, everything changes in a blink. Suddenly, you find yourself instantly transported to your desired location, skipping the journey entirely. There is no transition, no blur of scenery rushing by, only a silent, instant shift from one place to another. The buildings, trees, and structures at your destination appear congruously as they would have in the physical world, but their sudden immediacy defies the laws of physics as we understand them. You had set out to travel, but time and space folded upon themselves, leaving you both disoriented and intrigued. The implications of this phenomenon cause you to question not only the reality around you but also your existence within this reality. It signifies an eerie bending of conventional norms, offering a glimpse into the new rules that govern this afterlife realm.",
    "Over time though,": "the vitality fades and the spirit moves on to the next plane of existence.\n\nDescriptive Prompt: Illustrate an image showing the gradual fading of a human spirit's vitality in the afterlife realm, a replica of the physical world, marking a significant transformation in its journey. Display objects becoming increasingly transparent, signifying the spirit's dwindling interaction with the earthly plane. Showcase this phenomenon occurring over a period represented by sped-up transitions of the day and night in the backdrop. In the latter half, depict the spirit beginning to ascend towards a mysterious, luminous realm, representing the 'next plane of existence'. Use bright, ethereal hues such as soft gold and iridescent blues to convey a sense of otherworldliness in contrast to the spirit's former realm. The overall tone should be mysterious but peaceful, emphasizing the natural progression of the spirit's journey beyond the familiar and corporeal existence.",
    "the vitality fades": "Prompt: \n\nDepict a scene where the inherent vibrancy and vitality of the afterlife realm gradually begins to fade away. It should capture the moment when the lively imitation of the physical world starts to become translucent. The once-solid, familiar objects like houses, trees, or cars mimicking earthly life should now exhibit a ghostly semi-transparency, losing their animate quality. They start to shimmer and dissolve, giving an impression that they are gradually vanishing into the ether. You may notice something akin to a sunset where the vivid hues slowly wash away into melancholic shades of gray, symbolic of the fading vitality. The inhabitants should gradually reveal understanding and acceptance in their expressions, prepared for their imminent transition to the next afterlife plane. This scene should encapsively present the poignant yet strangely serene phase where the afterlife echoes the fleeting essence of mortality before transitioning into another stage of spiritual existence.",
    "and the spirit moves on to the next plane of existence.": "Create an image depicting the moment when the spirit transitions to the next plane of existence. This delicate moment is characterized by loss of physical anchoring, detachment, and peaceful progression into a different form of reality. The spirit is visually represented as a translucent, ethereal entity that glows with a mysterious energy. As the vitality of the worldly existence fades, it metamorphoses into a magnificent spectrum of colors, blending and merging in harmony, hinting at the transformation taking place. The environment reflects the increasing ethereal and transcendent nature of the spirit. Celestial bodies, variegated luminescence, multidimensional swirls, and mystical symbols subtly emerging from the spirit's path can be incorporated. This is a serene and tranquil scene: there are no storms, turbulence, or intense emotions accompanying the transition. The spirit is moving toward an illuminated, otherworldly doorway or portal that symbolizes a gateway to a different reality or plane of existence. The grandeur of this transition is profound yet not frightening – it is filled with anticipation and mystery, not dread or fear."
