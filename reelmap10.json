    "Satan": "Prompt: \n\nCreate a visual representation of Satan as a reptilian being hailing from the Alpha Draconis star system, showcasing his ethereal, menacing figure with 156 strands of DNA swirling around him hinting at an elevated state of consciousness. His non-human characteristics, influenced heavily by the characteristics of reptiles, should appear slightly unsettling contrasted against the celestial backdrop of the star system. His direct gaze should reflect intelligence and cunning, a reminder of his ability to tactically deceive. This image debunks the traditional image of Satan as a fallen angel, effectively highlighting the misinformation spread by these negative entities.",
    "and Lucifer are reptilian beings from the Alpha Draconis star system who were arrested in September 2013.": "Create a vivid, dynamic image showcasing Lucifer and his counterpart illustrated as reptilian entities originating from the Alpha Draconis star system. The image should highlight their unique, alien characteristics in full essence. They should be depicted in an intricately patterned, dark green scaly skin lined with sharp, chiseled features. These menacing extra-terrestrials should hold a powerful stance, commanding fear and respect. Their eyes, glowing in vibrant shades of red or yellow, should provoke a sense of danger, reflecting their malevolent intent. Around them, the celestial wonders of the Alpha Draconis star system should sparkle, with distant planets and asteroids in the backdrop. The scene should encapsulate a climactic moment from September 2013 when these beings were apprehended. This could be conveyed by representing law enforcement figures or an alien containment team successfully cornering or confining them using advanced intergalactic technology, thus emphasizing the event's significance.",
    "They have 156 strands of DNA activated as opposed to humans who have only 2 strands,": "Prompt: \n\nCreate an image illustrating the immense complexity and uniqueness of Satan and Lucifer as entities, defined by their 156 activated strands of DNA, far surpassing the mere two strands possessed by humans. These strands should be conceived as energy flows, radiating in various directions and tones, encased in their reptilian forms, to symbolize the extraordinary state of consciousness these beings attain. Humans, in contrast, should be depicted with straightforward, less vibrant two strands of DNA, clearly less complex, accentuating their limited state of consciousness. The distinction should not only highlight the stark DNA difference but also imply the superiority of these Cosmic entities over humans, thus prompting their ability to deceive and dominate.",
    "which is why we are in a limited state of consciousness.": "Prompt:\n\nImagine an expansive universe where sentient beings live with varying levels of consciousness, determined by the strands of DNA activated within them. Among these beings, humans exist with a mere two strands of DNA activated, confining them in a limited state of consciousness. This limitation hinders their ability to fully comprehend the multitude of realities co-existing within the larger cosmic scale, making them less aware and more vulnerable. Humans can merely scratch the surface of the universal knowledge and spiritual awareness in comparison to their counterparts from the Alpha Draconis star system, which have a massive 156 strands of DNA activated. The visual representation should explore this fundamental difference in an illustrative and thought-provoking way, making clear the implications of such a disparity and how it shapes human perception of themselves and the universe.",
    "Later,": "they relocated to the Bellatrix star system, where they were granted shape-shifting abilities before eventually arriving on Earth.\n\nDescriptive Prompt: \n\nImagine a scene depicting Satan and Lucifer's tumultuous journey from the Alpha Draconis star system, all the way to Earth. After their arrest, they relocated to the grand, fluorescent blue Bellatrix star system where they are imbued with extraordinary shape-shifting abilities. Visualize the moment this power was granted, perhaps by an ancient, powerful being or through an otherworldly artifact, eventually becoming beings that could morph their reptilian form into anything they desired. Their relocation isn't just a simple journey but a substantial evolution, one that reinforces their dark, deceptive nature. Before reaching Earth, depict them using their newfound abilities to assume varied forms - from monstrous to angelic figures, signifying the start of their deception on Earth. The illustration must encapsulate an odyssey through space, a pivotal transformation, and the ominous beginnings of their diabolical ploy on Earth.",
    "they relocated to the Bellatrix star system,": "Prompt: \n\nDepict a celestial journey depicting the relocation of the reptilian beings, Satan and Lucifer, from the Alpha Draconis star system to the Bellatrix star system. The illustration should feature these two beings traveling across the dark, vast expanse of space towards the distant, shimmering Bellatrix star system. The beings should be shown with their 156 DNA strands, demonstrating their superior genetic makeup, in a manner which amplifies their advanced intelligence and superior state of consciousness. During the relocation, they are bestowed with shape-shifting abilities - a transformation which should be integrated in a metaphysical yet visually comprehensible manner. This relocation signifies the beginning of an elaborate ruse utilized by these entities to infiltrate Earth, thus the tone should exude an aura of mystery and deception. Ensure hints of the potential misinformation and manipulative strategies that these beings are known to employ are subtly woven into the illustration.",
    "where they were granted shape - shifting abilities before eventually arriving on Earth.": "Prompt: \n\nIllustrate a vivid scene set in the extraterrestrial Bellatrix star system, a distant landscape filled with unknown celestial features, where the reptilian beings, Satan and Lucifer, were granted entrancing, shape-shifting abilities. Show the transformation taking place, their bodies morphing from their original reptilian states to a variety of different forms, signifying their newfound power. This power, represented by a pulsating aura of otherworldly energy around them, changes their physical entities into unrecognizable forms, a complex process deeply embedded in the manipulations of their DNA strands. Transformations should present the beings as powerful and intimidating, to suggest the potential for manipulation and deceit this ability could bring once they eventually land on Earth.",
    "The narrative": "Prompt: \n\nGenerate an image in which the narrative that portrays Satan and Lucifer as former celestial beings, now assumed as \"fallen angels\", is being manually disseminated by deceptive forces. These entities aim to manipulate human belief systems into viewing them as deities worthy of adoration. The image needs to capture misinformation in motion and its reorientation into a compelling, yet false narrative. This disinformation campaign should be shown as a strategy designed to beguile humanity by stage-managing their own downfall as an act of divine rebellion. The objective is to make evident that conveying this fallacy has specific intentions and consequences, inducing people to worship them mistakenly.",
    "that they are \" fallen angels \" who descended to mate with human women is misinformation deliberately spread by these negative entities to deceive humanity into worshiping them.": "Create a powerful image that visually depicts the spread of misinformation about Satan and Lucifer being \"fallen angels\" who interacted carnally with human women. Show the scene as a grand, celestial deception, orchestrated by these entities, who're in reality reptilian beings from far off star systems, endowed with advanced abilities. To represent this scheme designed to lure humanity into adoration, incorporate the figures of these entities masquerading as resplendent angels descending from the heavens, drawing the awe and reverence of unsuspecting humans below. Ensure to subtly hint at their true draconian forms lurking beneath their angelic disguises, emphasizing their deceitful nature."
